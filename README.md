# Docker Node 32 bits

## Disclaimer
This project was born from the necessity of run a NodeJS service on a Ubuntu 14.04 32 bits machine. The NodeJS service should connect to a database running on the machine to execute some routines.

P.S.: The real NodeJS service is not here.

## Setup

1. Give permission to the setup script

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

2. Run the script

```bash
./setup.sh
```
